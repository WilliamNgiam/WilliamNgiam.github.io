I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Chicago in the [Awh/Vogel Lab](https://awhvogellab.github.io) studying _visual working memory_, the visual information maintained online for ongoing perception and cognition. Previously, I completed my PhD at the University of Sydney under the supervision of [Alex Holcombe](http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/Holcombe) and [Patrick Goodbourn](https://psychologicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au/research/msps-research-groups/gbb/gbb-lab).

I am also passionate about improving science through reproducible and open practices. I founded the ReproducibiliTea journal club at the University of Chicago (see my most recent YouTube video below) and am an instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) to teach introductory coding and data science skills.

On this website, you will find preprints of my publications, my conference posters and my conference talk slides. I hope to add blog posts and other content in the future! The best way to follow me is via my Twitter:
