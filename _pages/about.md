I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Chicago in the <a href="https://awhvogellab.com" target="_blank">Awh/Vogel Lab</a> studying **_visual working memory_**, the visual information maintained online for ongoing perception and cognition. I completed my PhD at the University of Sydney under the supervision of <a href="http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/Holcombe" target="_blank">Alex Holcombe</a> and <a href="https://psychologicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au/research/msps-research-groups/gbb/gbb-lab" target="_blank">Patrick Goodbourn</a>.

I am also passionate about improving science, particularly by empowering early-career researchers to pursue reproducible and open practices. I founded and co-organize the ReproducibiliTea journal club at the University of Chicago, and am part of <a href="https://reproducibilitea.org/jc/2021/01/28/a-new-year,-a-new-reproducibilitea-steering-committee" target="_blank">the steering committee of ReproducibiliTea</a>! I also am a qualified instructor with <a href="https://carpentries.org/" target="_blank">The Carpentries</a> to teach introductory coding and data science skills.
