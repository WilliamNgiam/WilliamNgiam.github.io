I'm currently a doctoral research student at the University of Sydney, under the supervision of [Professor Alex Holcombe](http://sydney.edu.au/science/people/alex.holcombe.php) in the [Sydney University Perception and Action Lab](http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/Holcombe). My research examines the visual working memory system, which is responsible for the online maintenance of visual information and is essential for perception and cognition. My main focus is on the highly limited information capacity of this system, specifically what the architecture of visual working memory causes this limit and how factors interact with this architecture to overcome this limit.

You can find out more about me or my research using the links in the header of this page.
