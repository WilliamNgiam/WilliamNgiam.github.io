### About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Chicago with [Edward Awh and Edward Vogel](https://awhvogellab.github.io), examining the neural mechanisms of visual working memory, the system reponsible for online maintenance of visual information for ongoing perception and cognition. 

I completed my PhD at the University of Sydney, under the supervision of [Alex Holcombe](http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/Holcombe) and [Patrick Goodbourn](https://psychologicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au/research/msps-research-groups/gbb/gbb-lab). My thesis was on the influence of chunking and learning on visual working memory capacity.

I am also passionate about improving science through reproducible and open science practices, and am currently training to become an instructor with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) to teach introductory coding and data science skills.

### This Website

On this website, you will find preprints of my publications, my conference posters and conference presentation slides. I hope to add blog posts and other content in the future documenting my journey as an Australian early-career researcher in the United States.
