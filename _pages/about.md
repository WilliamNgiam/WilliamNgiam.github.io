I am a postdoctoral researcher studying how we encode and maintain information in **_visual working memory_** for ongoing perception and cognition, in the <a href="https://awhvogellab.com" target="_blank">Awh/Vogel Lab</a> at the University of Chicago. I focus on how learning and experience changes how visual information is represented in memory, using those insights to uncover the nature of capacity limits in working memory.

I am passionate about **improving science**, particularly by empowering early-career researchers to pursue reproducible and open research practices. I serve on the <a href="https://reproducibilitea.org/jc/2021/01/28/a-new-year,-a-new-reproducibilitea-steering-committee" target="_blank"> steering committee of ReproducibiliTea</a>, a grassroots initiative to start Open Science communities at local institutions. I am also trying to grow a diamond open-access journal, the Journal for Reproducibility in Neuroscience, as Editor-in-Chief. 

I grew up in Sydney, Australia, where I completed my PhD, at the University of Sydney under the supervision of <a href="http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/Holcombe" target="_blank">Alex Holcombe</a> and <a href="https://psychologicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au/research/msps-research-groups/gbb/gbb-lab" target="_blank">Patrick Goodbourn</a>. I'm a 7-time marathon finisher, espresso coffee enthusiast, and I spent 65,023 minutes listening on Spotify last year.

On this website, you will find my preprints, conference posters, talk slides and blog posts.
