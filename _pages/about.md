I am currently a postdoctoral research at the University of Chicago with [Edward Awh](https://psychology.uchicago.edu/directory/edward-s-awh) and [Edward Vogel](https://psychology.uchicago.edu/directory/edward-k-vogel), researching the neural mechanisms of attention and visual working memory. The visual working memory system is responsible for the online maintenance of visual information and is essential for perception and cognition. My main focus is on the highly limited information capacity of this system, specifically the system architecture of visual working memory that causes this limit and how factors interact with this architecture to overcome this limit.

I was previously a doctoral research student at the University of Sydney, under the supervision of [Professor Alex Holcombe](http://sydney.edu.au/science/people/alex.holcombe.php) and [Patrick Goodbourn](https://psychologicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au/research/msps-research-groups/gbb/gbb-lab) in the [Sydney University Perception and Action Lab](http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/Holcombe). My thesis examined the influence of chunking and learning on visual working memory capacity.
