I am currently a postdoc at the University of Chicago with [Edward Awh and Edward Vogel](https://awhvogellab.github.io), researching the neural mechanisms of attention and visual working memory, the system reponsible for online maintenance of visual information for pereception and cognition.

I completed my PhD at the University of Sydney, under the supervision of [Professor Alex Holcombe and Patrick Goodbourn](http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/Holcombe). My thesis examined the influence of chunking and learning on visual working memory capacity.
