I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Chicago in the <a href="https://awhvogellab.com" target="_blank">Awh/Vogel Lab</a> studying **_visual working memory_**, the visual information that is maintained online for ongoing perception and cognition. I focus on how learning and experience changes how the visual information is represented in memory, and use those insights to understand the nature of capacity limits for working memory. I completed my PhD at the University of Sydney under the supervision of <a href="http://www.openwetware.org/wiki/Holcombe" target="_blank">Alex Holcombe</a> and <a href="https://psychologicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au/research/msps-research-groups/gbb/gbb-lab" target="_blank">Patrick Goodbourn</a>.

I am also passionate about improving science, particularly by empowering early-career researchers to pursue reproducible and open practices. I am part of <a href="https://reproducibilitea.org/jc/2021/01/28/a-new-year,-a-new-reproducibilitea-steering-committee" target="_blank">the steering committee of ReproducibiliTea</a>, a grassroots initiative to start open science communities at local institutions, and I am currently Editor-in-Chief of <a href="https://jrn.epistemehealth.com/" target="_blank">the Journal for Reproducibility in Neuroscience</a>, a diamond open-access journal founded and operated by early-career researchers.

On this website, you will find preprints of my publications, my conference posters and talk slides. I hope to add blog posts and other content in the future!
