### ***Happy Lunar New Year!*** ***新年快乐!***

As the pandemic continues, celebrations of the Lunar New Year are subdued for some but for myself, it wasn't too different compared to previous years – a video call to my parents back in Australia and cooking some pan-fried dumplings for myself! Something that _has_ been different this year is that I am acutely aware of my racial identity and current living situation – I'm Australian-born with Malaysian-Chinese heritage, working internationally as a postdoc in America _during a pandemic_. (_What a bizarre combination._)

<a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/23/21300332/trump-coronavirus-racism-asian-americans" target="_blank">After months of xenophobic rhetoric by Trump,</a> anti-Asian sentiment seems to be on the rise, culminating in <a href="https://abc7.com/racism-anti-asian-american-chinese/10329128/" target="_blank">a recent increase in physical violence against Asians</a>, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/string-attacks-against-older-asians-leaves-big-city-chinatowns-edge-n1257157" target="_blank">particularly older, defenseless Asians</a>. These reports are particularly affecting – during my trips to get groceries, I avoid the gazes of people and take extra care to not get in the way of others, _just in case_. Even during my video calls with my parents, I wonder if my neighbors will take note that I'm speaking Chinese and perhaps tell me '<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-15/pauline-hanson-maiden-speech-2016/7847136" target="_blank">to go back where you came from</a>'. (<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-must-confront-anti-asian-racism-in-science/" target='_blank'>And I assure you, it's not just me who thinks this way</a>.)

There has been <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02681-y" target="_blank">recent commitment to diversity and equality in science and academia</a>, spurred by the <a href="https://blacklivesmatter.com/" target="_blank">Black Lives Matter movement</a>. After reading <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2020/06/what-ive-learned-about-being-black-scientist" target="_blank">what Neil A. Lewis, Jr. experiences as a Black scientist</a>, I was inspired to reflect on my racial identity and put my thoughts down in writing. I'm still connecting the dots – for the most part, I have never really considered my racial identity as a scientist but I'm starting to realize that how I am perceived may influence how my research is seen and how my academic career goes. That is, the same concerns I have going grocery shopping can very much be at play in science/academia.

### Not noticing the 'bamboo ceiling'

I'm not sure why I didn't really think about myself being Asian and becoming a scientist. One paradoxical reason might simply be that I grew up and did my study in Sydney <a href="https://www.news.com.au/national/how-asian-are-we-really-what-australias-census-2016-showed-us/news-story/2f055e32e74cbe4341953006379b6394" target="_blank">where Asians make up a significant proportion of the minority population</a>. At the University of Sydney, <a href="https://salvatorebabones.com/update-on-chinese-student-numbers-at-australias-g8-universities/" target="_blank">a significant proportion of international students are Chinese</a> and this was true for my undergraduate classes so far as I can remember. So, perhaps I never felt out of place or that it mattered that I was a person of color in a science major. Practicing some *chronological relativism*, I didn't think diversity was in the spotlight as much as it is now, but now that I think on it – almost all the lecturers and professors were white and male during my undergraduate and graduate years. This is perhaps not surprising to some – <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00759-1" target="_blank">science and academia is predominantly white and male</a>.

### But has being Asian impacted my science?

This is a tougher question to answer – I don't have any explicit examples of it impacting my research. Perhaps I have been overlooked for a conference talk, maybe someone thought better of having a conversation with me at a conference poster. But in these circumstances, I have been able to lean on the fact that I am (or at least ***sound***) Australian, who I think are perceived favorably in terms of research generally. I can't name a time where my research has been disregarded specifically based on who I am but I'm still a junior scientist after all. (_I did have to do an English speaking test for a student visa, despite having an undergraduate degree from and being enrolled in a graduate degree at an Australian institution, but I suppose that's part of the protocol...maybe_). 

But there are *forces* at play, even if I haven't noticed them. For example, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/01/asian-americans-science-math-bias/551903/" target="_blank">according to research by _The Atlantic,_ Asian Americans are expected to be good team players and worker bees.</a> The article mentions that Asian American women engineers were more likely to report they needed to keep their heads down and avoid confrontation and that Asian American women in STEM feel like "they have to be more skilled than white men to be seen as equally competent". Stereotypes of not being assertive or outgoing <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2019/03/04/research-suggests-bias-against-asian-americans-after-they-earn-degrees" target="_blank">may be harmful in terms of professional advancement</a>. <a href="https://issues.org/realnumbers-29/" target="_blank">Despite being among the majority of postdocs, Asians (especially Asian women) are underrepresented in leadership positions.</a> <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/features/2009/05/breaking-through-bamboo-ceiling-asian-american-scientists" target="_blank">And these forces have been around for a _while._</a> 

### Diversity in science matters

I've realized that nevertheless my Asian-Australian identity matters to me. <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2020/12/how-i-learned-celebrate-my-identity-first-generation-international-student" target="_blank">This reflection by Chee Kiang Ewe, detailing their journey from masking being a first-generation, international student to celebrating it feels somewhat akin to my realization.</a> A little thing I've done is have my Chinese name in <a href="https://twitter.com/will_ngiam" target="_blank_">my Twitter handle</a> and nothing bad has come of it so far. I'll try and be mindful to be supportive and boost the signal for other Asian researchers when I can!

But more importantly beyond navigating my identity in science is recognizing the need for diversity and representation across all of science. The culture of science is something we're soon to dive into at our ReproducibiliTea journal club (see these insightful pieces on <a href="https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-33/november-2020/bropenscience-broken-science" target="_blank">#bropenscience</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14258" target="_blank">decolonizing computational sciences</a>) and I'm eager to learn from those discussions. I hope that in some way, advocating for initiatives that promote diversity will strengthen the science community and we'll all be better for it!
