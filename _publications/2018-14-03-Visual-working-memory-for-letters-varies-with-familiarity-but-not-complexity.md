excerpt: 'This paper looks at whether stimulus complexity influences the encoding rate and capacity of the visual working memory system. Using letters of varying perimetric complexity, we find visual working memory performance is influenced by stimulus familiarity but not stimulus complexity.'

This paper looks at whether complexity and familiarity influences the encoding rate and capacity of the visual working memory system. Using letters of varying perimetric complexity, we find visual working memory performance is influenced by stimulus familiarity but not stimulus complexity. This is currently a preprint and under review for publication. This manuscript is not yet peer reviewed.
