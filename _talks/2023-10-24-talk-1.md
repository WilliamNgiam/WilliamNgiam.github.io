The following video recording and slides come from my talk for the Neurocognition and Work Talk Series at the Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors. The presentation is titled *Rethinking attention in visual working memory (and its researchers)*. In this talk, I share concerns about whether we are making scientific progress with current academic structures and the poorly defined theoretical framework in my field. I share empirical work that tackles long-standing binarised debates, suggesting that current models are not in fundamental theoretical opposition, and then present a newly created theoretical map for visual working memory.
