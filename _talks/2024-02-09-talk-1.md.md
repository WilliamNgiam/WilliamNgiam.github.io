The following slides come from my talk at the University of Texas Austin for the psychology and neuroscience departments. The presentation is titled *Are scientists attending to the right things?*. In this talk, I share concerns about whether we are making scientific progress with current academic structures and the poorly defined theoretical framework in my field. I share empirical work that tackles long-standing binarised debates, suggesting that current models are not in fundamental theoretical opposition, and then present a newly created theoretical map for visual working memory. I also present a vision for how scientists can collectively reform academic structures and meet the challenges of the credibility revolution.
